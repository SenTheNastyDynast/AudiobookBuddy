For instant playback functionality, please install MPV: https://mpv.io/. You might also need to pip install mpv, edge-tts, or whatever other requirement is asked for since I already forgot what they are.

Simple edge-tts GUI with CMD interface. Just run the .py file. If you don't fill out the Filename input, clicking on generate will only play back the text/file.

When entering a filename, do not use spaces and use the .wav or .mp3 extension. eg. my-audio-file.wav

When choosing "File", look for the search bar on the bottom of the app and make sure you select a .txt file in UTF-8 format.

Saved files should be saved in the current directory the app is run from, please change the output directory for the "Open Folder" button directly on the .py file.
